# bwgen-nouveau
A reimplementation of bwgen in the Godot game engine.
- Live version might be at [live/](live/)

## Why?

bwgen was a tool to create binaural beats and worked on windows, but the original version is no 
longer available online and the website has been somewhat abandoned.

I was playing in godot for some VR stuff and wanted to see if I oculd reimplement bwgen in godot. 
It seems like it has been possible so why not release it?

Given it's a game engine, it's a bit unweildy but it works.  It's also cross-platform - windows/mac/linux 
and web.

CI is setup here on github, feel free to PR example sequences in to `sequences/` in github or if you're
a coder/designer, help pretty up the interface.
